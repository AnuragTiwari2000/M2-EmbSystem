## COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION

### Arduino
     Arduino is a one type of micro controller circuit ATmega328P. The programme is carried out in the arduino by using the arduino software in the programming languages like C      and C++ .
### SENSORS
#### Water level sensor
    The ultrasonic sensor is a non contact type device which uses the sound waves. There are 2 ports on the front, one port generates the ultrasonic waves like a micro speaker        and other port receivers. The ultrasonic waves like a small micro phone. The liquid level is calculated, on the basis of the total time required for the sound to reflect
     back.
### ACTUATORS

#### Motor Driver Circuit
    Motor Driver circuit is used to switch on and off the based upon the signals received from the sensors.

#### LEDâ€™s
    Shows the status of motor wether it is on or off.

### Power Supply
     AC power supply is converted to DC and given to the circuit in order to run it.
     
### Resistors
     to protect LED and complete the circuit.
